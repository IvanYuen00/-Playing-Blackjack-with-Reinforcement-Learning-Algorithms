# Playing BlackJack with Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
Around the world, BlackJack has been one of the most popular card games, whether for a
party game, for competitions, or in the casino.It is commonly used for studies and research
in reinforcement learning, and in other learning algorithms like neural networks. Not only is
its system of rule well defined, there are also well developed strategies that were discovered
by others.
This project aims to study and understand Blackjack by reinforcement learning, through the
environment in OpenAI Gym.
